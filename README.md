# Employee Management REST API

## Project Overview
The Employee Management REST API is a backend application built using **Python and FastAPI**.  
This project is designed to manage employee records within an organization by providing standard **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations.

The API follows proper **RESTful design principles** and is secured using **token-based authentication**.  
As required in the assignment, all API endpoints were tested exclusively using **Postman**.
